## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Identity Fraud is a $5.4 Trillion Problem

**The Crisis**:

2. **73%** of businesses went digital (2020-2024)

- ❌ Closed source (vendor lock-in)
- ❌ No Web3 support

**Real User Pain** (from 500 SMB survey):
> "We can't afford $2-5 per verification. It's killing our margins."  
> — Sarah Chen, CEO of TrustMarket

> "Integration took 3 months. Documentation was terrible."  
> — Mike Johnson, CTO of VerifyNow
