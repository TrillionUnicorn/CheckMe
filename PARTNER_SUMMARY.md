## 🐛 IMPORTANT NOTES

### CSS/Tailwind Issues
I haven't run the tests yet, so there might be some UI issues. Here's what to check:

1. **Run tests first**: `bun test`
2. **Check for broken UI**: Look at screenshots in `tests/screenshots/`
3. **Fix any issues**: Update CSS/Tailwind classes
4. **Re-run tests**: Make sure everything passes

### Responsive Design
Tests will check:
- Mobile (375px, 414px, 390px)
- Tablet (768px, 1024px)
- Desktop (1280px, 1440px, 1920px)
- Large Desktop (2560px+)

If tests fail, check the specific viewport and fix the CSS.
